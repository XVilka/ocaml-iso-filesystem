ISO9660 Filesystem Library for OCaml
====================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jonludlam/ocaml-iso-filesystem.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jonludlam/ocaml-iso-filesystem)

A library that implements the ISO9660 filesystem. It exposes the
contents via the KV_RO defined by the Mirage project. Extended
filenames are supported via the Rock Ridge extensions.

Currently read-only.

See lib_test/test.ml for an example of usage.
